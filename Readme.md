# Introduction

Julia code for a Financial Econometrics (MSc) course at UNISG. 

The current version is tested on Julia 1.1.

The code does not use any specialized econometrics packages, just general purpose packages (plotting, optimization, distributions,...). I believe that improves the learning of econometric methods.

The .ipynb files are Julia notebooks. They use data in the Data folder and Julia functions in the jlFiles folder. The notebooks are meant to be used together with my lecture notes (the pdf file).

You use IJulia to edit and run these Julia notebooks. You can either install Julia/IJulia on your local computer (see https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl for instructions) or use a web service (www.JuliaBox.com or https://cocalc.com).
